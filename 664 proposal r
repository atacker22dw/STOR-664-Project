# An Examination of Pandemic Air Quality

Localized air pollution and a global pandemic are two of the most tragically salient realities of the day.  The latter challenges the well-being, livelihood, and accepted societal norms of the current generation while the former threatens the very existence of future generations.  Unfortunately for some, these trends coincide in what must be the nexus of non-ideal respiratory conditions.  Yet, is it possible that out of this bleak forecast, one can glean a positive outcome? 
	
        	Prolonged and wide-spread quarantine and social distancing measures have left a myriad of residual effects, but one of the most promising seems to be a lessened dependence on automobiles.  Even if only temporarily, people confined to their houses and apartments were less compelled to take to the roads.   Intuitively, it would seem that areas with high infection rates would simultaneously see a diminishing rate of air pollutants, particularly carbon monoxide. In particular, our initial hypothesized relation between lagged pollutant counts (as a proxy for human movement) and the number of Covid-19 cases is a negative correlation; this is driven by the idea that a rational citizen’s reaction to an increase in cases would be to minimize excursions to the outside world for the sake of self-preservation. Now, undoubtedly, the relative presence of communicable disease is not the only explanatory factor influencing fluctuating levels of air pollutants.  Even still related to the pandemic, other factors such as cultural demographics and political norms may be influential.  That is to say, it is conceivable that areas of historically conservative political leaning would experience minimal (if any) reduction in carbon emissions as a result of drastic outbreak if they fail to enforce quarantining protocols.  For precisely this reason, our analysis will include data from two distinct geographical areas – Raleigh, NC and Greenville, SC. 
	
        	These two cities were chosen quite intentionally so as to juxtapose political leanings (Greenville being historically conservative and Raleigh being conventionally liberal, or at least relatively so) while also controlling for other possible confounding variables.  That is to say, another potential source of variation in air pollution is local temperature, or more generally, climate.   Moreover, discrepancies in cultural convention surrounding commuter transportation may muddy causal inference. Insofar as Greenville and Raleigh are separated by a mere 200 miles, they experience largely the same weather patterns -- certainly more so than Greenville and say, Los-Angeles California.  These two cities also share a relatively analogous commuter convention (with available yet not ubiquitous public transportation options), the likes of which may not be seen if comparing Greenville to the subway city of New York.  These similarities aside, having group members who have spent substantial time in both areas, it seems clear that Greenville is certainly the relaxed, laissez-faire political counterpart to Raleigh’s more stringent regulation.


\section{Data Description}	
	
	The data used in this analysis comes from OpenAQ.orgf\footnote{https://openaq.org}.  OpenAQ is an organization that collects and provides data for air quality measurements in 95 countries.  They collect measurements of O3 (Ozone), CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), PM10 (Particulate Matter), PM2.5, SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide), and BC (Black Carbon) in specific locations and publish these results on their website.  By building this open source database of air quality, OpenAQ is encouraging collaboration between scientists across the globe in an attempt to fix air inequalities.  This data is ideal for our analysis because it provides us up-to-date measurements of different air pollutants in our specific locations. 
	
	The second of our two data sets is CDC tabulation of Covid-19 cases per day at a county resolution made available at USAFacts.org\footnote{https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/state/south-carolina}.  That is to say, with respect to the two cities of interest in our proposal, we have per day infection counts for Wake County NC and Greenville County SC.   Also, since the data is timestamped, we can simply join the air quality data with the lagged air pollutant data to assess trends between the two. More pointedly, these two data sets, are aimed at providing a holistic conception of fluctuations in air quality and infections diseases in tandem.  
	
	We will employ a number of data reduction and cleaning techniques to ensure that the finalized data set is not so unwieldy as to overburden the analysis tools at our disposal.  That is to say, out of six possible measurements of various types of Air Pollutants, this analysis will focus around one – PM 2.5.  The rationale for this choice is two-fold.  At a basic level, not every city contains the same or even comparable pollutant readings; many areas prioritize particulate air matter as the primary concern.  Therefore, it is necessary to choose a metric that is shared by the two cities of interest, and PM 2.5 satisfies this requirement.  Secondly, we desire an air pollutant that is a natural proxy for automobile usage.  Now, intuitively, carbon monoxide is the air pollutant most directly related to rampant utilization of internal combustion engines, but such a measurement is not consistently available in both Greenville and Raleigh.  Therefore, we turn to the next best alternative.  Particulate Air Matter which is derived from chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and sources such as power plants, industries, and automobiles seems to fit this bill.  That is to say, PM 2.5 is distinguished by its granularity, but can potentially subsume carbon emissions under its own heading.   As a more subtle, yet certainly no less important point, the link between carbon emissions and global temperature fluctuations is a well-established vein of scientific inquiry.  Thus, it would seem that deriving some sort of inference (whether it be causal or merely correlative) predicated on a link between pandemic induced isolation, a corresponding reduction in air pollutants, and the subsequent potentially benevolent effects on the global climate, would be facilitated by choosing the best available proxy for carbon monoxide, namely PM 2.5, as the pollutant of interest. 
	
	The second key reduction used, is the time span to be considered.   Originally, our group considered including daily readings on various types of pollutants since the onset of the pandemic in the latter half of 2019.  However, such an expansive scope of interest quickly became cumbersome.  At just over 19,000 observations, such a data set embodied the essence of “big data” but was simply too large for the techniques (diagnostic, model selection, and inference included) available to us to be tractable.  Therefore, we have narrowed the time span to include January 2020 through September 2020 with hourly readings averaged across a day to further scale the observation count by a factor of 124.  This was specifically chosen as it coincides with a small time period before the most explicit quarantine policies (such as state-wide stay at home orders) went into effect as well as a more prolonged time after such mandates had been lifted.  Note, this is not to say that the pandemic has been eradicated, or even that it is any less of a poignant threat, in September 2020, only that mandated stay at home orders have largely been lifted and the economy is operating on a modified basis.  
	
	By contrast, the pandemic infection count is was garnered already in a more malleable form.  Counts were produced once a day, so the only data reduction necessary was simply restricting attention to the two aforementioned counties of interests as opposed to considering the nearly 3200 counties available in the data set.  Finally, we were able to bind the three respective time series together to create one, coherent file containing a substantial yet manageable 500 observations.  To provide a clear insight into the specifics of this data set, a subset of the first ten rows has been reproduced and displayed below.
